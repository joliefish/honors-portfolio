<h4>Husky ADAPT Toy Adaptation Workshop</h4>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/21au_husky_adapt.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>I had really broad interests entering college, one of which was accessibility and its intersection with engineering. I ended up participating in a Husky ADAPT toy adaptation workshop with my friend, learned a lot about how to make toys more accessible, and also tried my hand at soldering for the first time. Unfortunately the event was late, and my commute made it inconvenient to attend more workshops. Still, I am thankful for the resources ENGRUD advising provided and these skills I've learned from RSO events.</p>

<h4>Medicinal Herb Scavenger Hunt</h4>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/22sp_clas205.png %}" alt="" /></span>I ended up taking CLAS 205 without much thought about my spring quarter classes since I was so burnt out from winter quarter. At first it seemed underwhelming that the bulk of the class was memorization of latin and greek bases (and my memorization skills are not too strong, so it felt tedious), but I ended up enjoying the class much more than I expected! My instructor, Lexi, was super enthusiastic and created fun activities and slide decks that made the class more fun than just memorization. We also went on a scavenger hunt to the UW Medicinal Herb Garden, which I didn't know existed on campus. I learned more about English and discovered that my new favorite latin base is <i>glomer</i>, meaning "ball of yarn."</p>

<h4>CSE 163 Final Project</h4>
<p><span class="image left"><object data="{% link /assets/pdfs/22su_cse163.pdf %}" width="500" height="500" type='application/pdf'></object></span>For the final project, my friend and I analyzed 20,000 reviews from Steam, a video game distribution service. We ambitiously decided to investigate four research questions, and ended up having to do a lot of the coding in the last few days before the deadline. It was satisisfying to create our own visualizations and apply the skills we learned throughout the quarter to a new dataset. We found that there is a significant difference in the words people use in reviews recommending compared to not recommending a particular game. The experience reaffirmed my interest in research and I began exploring the UW Undergraduate Research Database for more data science opportunities (to be explored in fall)!</p>
