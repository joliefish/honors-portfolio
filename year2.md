<h4>DubHacks '22</h4>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/22au_walkable.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>I participated in DubHacks '22, a hackathon run by UW students. I attended DubHacks virtually last year, but only attended a couple workshops and didn't submit a project. This year, I met new people and worked with them that weekend to prototype and design an app, Walkable. It was a super fun experience (and the food was good!). I learned a lot about the design process, working in a team, and some new technology as well. Here's <a href="https://devpost.com/software/walkable-3xqkbz">our prototype of Walkable</a>. I feel that I understand more of what designing a full app is like, and I hope to use those skills to create more tools in the future.</p>

<h4>SDP All Team Meeting</h4>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/22au_atm_vis.png %}" alt="" /></span>For my Experiential Learning, I'm researching the Natural Language Processing (NLP) / Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline. One activity I contributed to was the All Team Meeting, which had a theme around medicines and remedies used. I created a frequency over time visualization of keywords mentioned in the diaries. I had previously only learned how to write code in a classroom environment, so it was exciting seeing how I could create visualizations that helped the team learn new insights about the information. For example, many of us were intrigued by how the use of the word pain increased while mentions of his stomach and bowel issues decreased at the same time, suggesting to us that his illnesses were more severe and impactful on his life at that time. It was also great working with the rest of the team and seeing the data from a more historical perspective, which other team members had.</p>
